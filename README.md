Heart disease is considered a significant cause of mortality around the world. Due to difficulties in providing accurate diagnoses, experts have turned to machine learning techniques in order to provide more accurate results to reduce the chances of misdiagnoses and fatality caused by cardiovascular diseases. 

We will be exploring [the heart disease Cleveland database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). The cleveland database includes 302 rows and 14 variables: 
    - Age (Years)
    - Sex (1=male, 0=female)
    - CP: Chest pain type (Value 1: typical angina,  Value 2: atypical
           angin, - Value 3: non-anginal pa, -- Value 4: asymptoma)
    - trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm HG)
    - chol: Serum cholestoral (mg/dl)
    - fbs: Fasting blood sugar>120mg/dl (1=true,0=false)
    - restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0=normal, 1= has  
               ST-T wave abnormality)
    - thalach: max heart rate achieved
    - exang: Exercise induced agina (1=yes, 0=no)
    - oldpeak: ST deression induced by exercise relative to rest
    - slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1=upsloping,2=flat, 
             3=downsloping)
    - ca: Number of major vessels(0-3)
    - thal: 3=normal, 6=fixed defect, 7=reversable defect
    - num: Diagnosis of heart disease (0=absence, 1,2,3,4= present)

It is a multivariate dataset with categorical, integer and real variables. There are also variables with missing values (ca and thal)
